It's important to serve static content in a static fashion so that search engines can index the information easier and it can be served faster

If we want to populate a home page with blog post data, we can also load the page in a static fashion

But for content like a user dashboard, server side rendering and client side rendering both seem to be valid options


If a static page requires authentication, then what do we do?
-probably just have to check for authentication first (validating a token on page load)

API stuff:
-it seems like only files in the pages/api directory will  be serverless functions
-but the code used to write to files is also considered back end code...
